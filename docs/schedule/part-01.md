## Classes

### 2025/01/22 (Welcome)

Things to do after class:
* Read the [syllabus](..).
* Complete the [HCD pre-survey](https://go.aerospace.illinois.edu/AE353-Sp25-HCD-Survey-Pre) by 11:00am on Friday, January 24.
* (Optional) Start trying to follow the ["Setup" instructions](../setup) so you can run course code on your own computer.

### 2025/01/24 (Models, part 1)

Things to do after class:
* Complete the [group preferences form](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1443554131) for the first design project by 11:00am on Monday, January 27.
* Complete [HW1 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/176602/assessment/2503751) by 11:00am on Wednesday, January 29.
* (Optional) Start trying to follow the ["Setup" instructions](../setup) so you can run course code on your own computer.

Useful resources:
* [Notes on models from class](../notes/20250124-models-part1.pdf).
* [Reference page on state space models](../reference/state-space-models).
* [Chapter 3.2 (State Space Models)](https://fbswiki.org/wiki/index.php/System_Modeling) of our [reference text](https://fbswiki.org/wiki/index.php/Feedback_Systems:_An_Introduction_for_Scientists_and_Engineers).

### 2025/01/27 (Models, part 2)

Things to do after class:
* Complete [HW2 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/176602/assessment/2503752).
* (Optional) Start trying to follow the ["Setup" instructions](../setup) so you can run course code on your own computer.

### 2025/01/29 (Linearization)

Things to do after class:
* Complete [HW3 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/176602/assessment/2503753).
* Follow the ["Setup" instructions](../setup) so you can run course code on your own computer. You will need this both to complete [HW3]((https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/176602/assessment/2503753)) and to start [DP1](../projects/01-catbot) (your first design project).
