<!--
  Add '$' as an extra inline math delimiter. It is now easiest to use $ ... $ for
  inline math and $$ ... $$ for block (display) math. What the preprocessor will do
  is convert $ ... $ to \\( ... \\) and $$ ... $$ to \\[ ... \\]. Note the double-
  backslash, so "\\" is interpreted as "\" - if you want to use "\[ ... \]" directly
  in your markdown, you need to write it as "\\[ ... \\]".
