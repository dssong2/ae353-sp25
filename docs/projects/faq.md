## May I watch videos that are submitted by other students?

Yes. All videos will be available in the [AE353 (Spring 2025) Project Videos](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/channel/channelid/369105032) channel on Illinois Media Space as soon as they are submitted by your colleagues. You may watch these videos whenever you want, even before you submit your own.

If you are inspired by a video, or if watching a video strongly influences the way you proceed with your own design project, then you must **acknowledge and cite** this video in your report (and in your own video, if appropriate). Failure to do so would be considered [plagiarism](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-402/).

## How do I get started?

The first thing you should do is [follow the instructions to download and run course code](../setup), verify that you can run the simulation, and mess around a little bit with different actuator commands to get a sense for how the system responds.

After that, if you have read the entire project description and are not sure how to proceed, then take your best guess and ask a question on [Discussions](https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/54818/discussion_topics). Improving your ability to get unstuck by asking a good question is an explicit goal of this course.
