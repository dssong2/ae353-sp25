| M1 | All equations should be numbered in parentheses flush right. |
| M2 | The number of significant figures (or digits after the decimal place) should be both consistent and reasonable. |
| M3 | Inline equations must not be taller than the standard line height. If they are, make them block equations. |
| M4 | Use symbols for greek letters rather than spelling them out. |

| S20 | Do not denote items in a list with a "/." |
| S21 | Capitalization should be consistent. |
| S22 | In Nomenclature, units should be listed at the end of the line. |

## Figures and Tables

| Label | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| F1 | Plots must provide useful information (e.g., do not show a plot of a quantity that is constant or is always zero). |
| F2 | Each figure or table must be referenced at least once by number in the text. |
| F3 | Each figure or table must have a caption and a number. |
| F4 | Legends must not cover up plots or obscure results. |
| F5 | Labels in legends should be descriptive names (text) or symbols (math) and should not be code variables (e.g., with underscores). |
| F6 | Figure captions must be written as one or more complete sentences that follow the same rules for grammar and punctuation as everything else. |
| F7 | Plots should not have titles — descriptions should go in captions or subcaptions. |
| F9 | The caption of a figure must be underneath the figure rather than above the figure. |
| F10 | The caption of a table must be above the table rather than below the table. |
| F11 | Table captions must be "definitive titles." In other words, unlike figure captions, table captions must not be a complete sentence, must have only the first word capitalized, and must have no period or other punctuation at the end. (Example: "Table 1  Buckling results for blade-stiffened panels") |
| F12 | Use both different colors and different line styles to distinguish between lines in the same plot. Doing this makes plots readable for people with color blindness and makes plots more readable for everyone else. |
| F13 | All lines in a plot should have a label in the legend. |
| F14 | If two different lines in a plot show upper and lower bounds on the same quantity (e.g., minimum and maximum torque), these lines should have the same style and should correspond to only one label in the legend (rather than two labels, one for each line). |
| F15 | Side-by-side plots — particularly ones that show results for comparison (e.g., results for different choices of initial condition) — should be the same size and should have the same axis limits. |
| F16 | Subfigures should be referred to by letter (e.g., (a), (b), etc.) and not by position (e.g., "left" or "right"). |
| F17 | Plots must be either vectorized images (e.g., PDF or SVG) or high-resolution rasterized images (e.g., PNG) and must not be screenshots or other low-resolution images. |
| F18 | References to figures and tables in the text should be by number (e.g., "Fig. 1", or "Figure 1" at the start of a sentence) and not by location (e.g., "the above figure"). |
| F19 | Each figure or table must be numbered in the order of their appearance in the document. |
| F20 | The font size of legends, axes, and captions should be both readable and close to the standard body text size. |
| F21 | Tables should have lines to clearly separate each entry. |
| F22 | The font of figure and table captions must only be bolded and the same size as standard body text. |


## Content

| Label | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| C1 | When describing performance, either use words that are widely understood to have a precise technical meaning or provide a definition yourself (i.e., say what you mean). |
| C2 | Use an italic upper-case "K" to denote the gain matrix for linear state feedback (unless you clearly explain some alternative notation). |
| C3 | Incorrect description of the system to be controlled. |
| C4 | Specify both the "of what" and "with respect to what" when talking about derivatives (including Jacobians). |
| C5 | The abstract should provide a summary of key results (usually quantitative) that were obtained. Placeholders can be used in drafts when final results aren't available yet. |
| C6 | Do not provide unnecessary information about the computer, programming language, application, etc., that you used for implementation. |
| C7 | Theory should be in the Theory section, not also in the Introduction. |
| C8 | Provide enough information about the system to be controlled (including a clear description, a schematic, and a citation, for example) so that readers will understand even if they have not previously seen or worked with that system. |
| C9 | Linear state feedback should be negative (i.e., "-Kx" and not "Kx") unless you clearly explain why you are taking a non-standard approach. |
| C10 | Either follow the four-step process to put a system in state space form that is described on the reference pages of the course website (in exactly the order that is suggested) or clearly explain and justify whatever alternative approach you are taking. |
| C11 | Our method of deriving a state space model requires linearizing about an equilibrium point that is both constant and known in advance. Any other method should be clearly explained and justified. |
| C12 | Justify your choice of equilibrium point (making clear if other equilibrium points exist or if yours was the only possible choice). |
| C13 | Be specific enough about your methods so that another engineer could reproduce them. |
| C14 | Only the real or imaginary part of an eigenvalue can be positive or negative, not the eigenvalue itself. |
| C15 | The choice of the gain matrix K and/or the rationale behind it are missing. |
| C16 | The abstract should be self-contained and provide a clear yet concise description of the purpose of the work, the methods applied, and the results (preferably quantitative), along with the conclusion presented objectively. |
| C17 | Do not provide unnecessary information for the introduction. |
| C18 | Incorrect conclusion that the system won't be asymptotically stable. |
| C19 | Specify what the new term refers to or consider adding a reference to support the example. |
| C20 | The provided feedback controller doesn't have outputs. |
| C21 | A nonlinear function cannot be identical to its linearized function. |
| C22 | Do not use F as a linearized function since it's already used for F(q). |
| C23 | Introduce a new variable before using it unless it is defined in the nomenclature. |
| C24 | Use specific criteria instead of subjective terms (i.e., good or bad). |
| C25 | Do not provide too much details about the following sections in the introduction. |
| C26 | In general, do not restate what has been said before unless summarizing main points in the conclusion. |
| C28 | Describe what A and B refer to by using widely accepted academic terms like “system matrix” and “input matrix”, or explain their physical meaning, rather than just calling them “matrices”. |
| C29 | Introduction should prepare the reader to understand the rest of your report and how it fits within a broader context. |
| C30 | Explicitly state values being plugged in. |
| C31 | Do not explain specific system details in the abstract without context, as it may confuse readers unfamiliar with the system. |
| C33 | x and u are the state space vector and input vector, not m and n. |
| C34 | The abstract does not align with the main body. (e.g., Some results mentioned in the abstract are not presented in the experimental results section.) |
| C35 | This content would go in the Theory section rather than Experimental Results. |
| C36 | Provide more details about the method you introduce, including the underlying theory. |
| C37 | Nomenclature should include all relevant variables and their respective physical definitions.  |
| C38 | Use a widely accepted notation or define any new symbols clearly. |
| C39 | q is not position. It could be generalized position. |
| C40 | Definition of a variable is duplicated in the nomenclature. |
| C41 | Justify why the new term needs to be introduced (consider adding a reference to support, for instance). |
| C42 | Incomplete sentence or contents. |
| C43 | Incorrect or incomplete derivation of the ordinary differential equations describing the system. |
| C44 | Do not include any unfinished text in the report. |
| C45 | Explain why the eigenvalues must be real and should not have an imaginary part. |
| C46 | The gain matrix must have as many rows as there are inputs and as many columns as there are states. |
| C47 | Experiments must be described in enough detail that they could be understood and repeated by a colleague. |
| C48 | The system to be controlled should be described in the Introduction and/or Theory sections and not in later sections. |
| C49 | The length of each simulation must be stated. |
| C50 | The initial conditions for each simulation must be stated. |
| C51 | While it may be appropriate to describe experiments that were used to iterate on your control design, there must be a comprehensive set of experiments that validate your final control design (where "final" means "after you have stopped making changes"). |
| C52 | Results from many experiments should be used to support an argument that your controller "works" (however you have chosen to define that word). Results from only one experiment or a small number of experiments do not provide sufficient evidence in general. |
| C53 | You should make clear what "success" means (i.e., what it means for your controller to "work"), for example by providing a quantitative measure of performance. |
| C54 | Words like "optimal," "optimized," "optimization," etc., must not be used without first defining a quantity that is being maximized (e.g., a reward) or minimized (e.g., a cost). |
| C55 | Results should be in the Results section, not also in the Experiments. |
| C56 | Do not use deterministic or absolute terms (e.g., trivial, absolute, always) unless you have indisputable evidence to support them. |
| C58 | Specify the conditions under which this situation occurs (e.g., if the robot moves too slowly to reach the cat pilot’s landing target, what were the robot’s position and the cat’s target distance?). |
| C59 | Discussion should be in the Discussion section, not also in the Conclusion. |
| C60 | Indicate the number of simulations performed. |
| C62 | The conclusion should summarize key findings, their significance, study limitations, and, if applicable, suggestions for future work. Placeholders can be used in drafts if final insights are still being refined. |
| C63 | Specify the goal of the "future improvement", such as enhancing specific criteria or addressing other relevant aspects. |
| C65 | Discussion should be in the Discussion section, not also in the Experiments. |
| C66 | Do not provide unnecessary information for the conclusion. |
| C67 | Clarify what the quantity refers to (e.g., whether it pertains to pitch or pitch rate). |
| C68 | Do not draw conclusions that are not supported by the findings presented in the Results and Discussion section. |
| C69 | Clearly describe your methodology instead of vague statements like 'writing more code' or 'doing calculations,' and consider adding a reference for clarity. |
| C71 | The equation does not align with the description provided in the text. |
| C72 | Do not list eigenvalues as a vector. |
| C73 | The results presented do not match what the Experiments section describes. |
| C74 | Provide quantitative evidence for your experimental results, such as plots and tables. |
