In order to use the `optimal-observer.py` example in this directory, you will need to use the `ae353-bokeh` environment that was created in the example from March 5 (see `ae353-sp25/examples/20250305/README.md`). Assuming you already created this environment, then run the following command to activate it:

```
conda activate ae353-bokeh
```

Then, run the example as follows:

```
bokeh serve optimal-observer.py
```
